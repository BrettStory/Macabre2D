# Macabre2D

A 2D game engine built on top of the MonoGame framework. This project was started on April 23, 2016.

## Thanks

Many other developer and designer efforts have made creating Macabre2D a lot easier. I won't possibly remember all of them, but I sure can try.

Everyone who has ever contributed to [MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame). It's such a beautiful and great framework, it's hard to believe that it's open source and unmonetized beyond donations.

Jan Karger ([@punker76](https://twitter.com/punker76)), Brendan Forster ([@shiftkey](https://twitter.com/shiftkey)), Dennis Daume ([@flagbug](https://twitter.com/flagbug)), and Alex Mitchell ([@Amrykid](https://twitter.com/Amrykid)) for maintaining [MahApps](https://mahapps.com/). MahApps gives Macabre2D the flat, Windows/Metro style that it has.

Marc Stan ([marcstan.net](https://marcstan.net)) for their work on [MonoGame.Framework.WpfInterop](https://github.com/MarcStan/MonoGame.Framework.WpfInterop) which allows the display of a MonoGame scene in a WPF application.

Austin Andrews ([@Templarian](https://twitter.com/Templarian)) for their efforts creating great icons for the Material Design Icons project.
