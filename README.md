# Macabre2D

A 2D game engine built on top of the MonoGame framework. This project was started on April 23, 2016.

## Supported Platforms

Currently, the Macabre2D editor only supports Windows. The framework itself is technically setup to work with any platform; however, only Windows has been tested.

## Source Code

The full source code is available here from GitHub:

 * Clone the source: `git clone https://github.com/BrettStory/Macabre2D`
 * Set up the root submodules by calling the following at the base of the repository: `git submodule update --init`
 * Set up the MonoGame submodules by calling the following in the MonoGame folder: `git submodule update --init`
 * Run MonoGame/Protobuild.exe to generate MonoGame project files and solutions.
 * Run BuildMonoGame.bat to build the MonoGame solutions required by Macabre2D.
 * Open Macabre2D.sln. From here you can run the editor or example projects.

## Thanks

Many other developer and designer efforts have made creating Macabre2D a lot easier. I won't possibly remember all of them, but I sure can try.

Everyone who has ever contributed to [MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame). It's such a beautiful and great framework, it's hard to believe that it's open source and unmonetized beyond donations.

MahApps gives Macabre2D the flat, Windows/Metro style that it has.
